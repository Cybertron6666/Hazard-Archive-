## ü§ì Dear Skids
**Good for you,** you decided to skid something. <br>
We can't stop you, but just know you're pathetic. <br>
<br>
I hope you end up on the streets begging for spare change.

## Installation 

#### Compiled Version (Easier but more buggy)
```sh-session
Visit: https://github.com/Rdimo/Hazard-Nuker/releases
Download the latest release (Hazard.zip) and extract the EXE to your desktop.
Finally, run the executable and enjoy!
```

#### Source Code Version (More complicated but less buggy)
```sh-session
Click the green "Code" button.
Click "Download ZIP"
Extract the ZIP to a folder.

Run setup.bat, which will install all dependencies and open the script.
After that, every time you'd like to use Hazard, simply open start.bat

NOTE: Make sure you have Python 3.9.5 or above installed from python.org (NOT MICROSOFT) & added to path.
```
